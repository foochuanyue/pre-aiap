# `Assignment 2:` Regression & Hyperparameter Tuning

## Overview

In this assignment, you will spend time on some foundational concepts, specifically __Bias and Variance__, and build a range of regression models.

---

## Deliverables
For this assignment, there are three deliverables.

1. Edited Jupyter Notebooks with your workings.

2. Functions/classes in Python modules that facilitates the data pipeline and modelling process.
   
3. A conda.yml file that replicates the environment you've used.

## Part 1: Bias & Variance
File: ['A2P1_bias_variance.ipynb'](A2P1_bias_variance.ipynb)

This part introduces the concept of bias-variance trade-off and why this trade-off exists.

---

## Part 2: Hyperparameters, Feature Selection, & Ensembling
File: ['A2P2_regression_tuning.ipynb'](A2P2_regression_tuning.ipynb)

This part covers hyperparameter tuning, regularisation and ensemble methods.
