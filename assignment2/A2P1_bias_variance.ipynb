Bias-variance trade off\n","\n","When developing AI/ML solutions, it is important to understand the bias-variance trade off. While it would be great to understand the definition of bias and variance (from a statistical perspective), it is mathematically involved and will take time to process. If you are interested to do so, a useful reference that you can refer to is this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrEyxfl2-a8) from Caltech. Alternatively, you can also look up articles, blog posts and/or other YouTube videos for a quick overview on the bias-variance tradeoff."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#### 2.1.
