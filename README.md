# Pre-AIAP

The pre-AIAP curriculum covers three fundamental AI/ML topics: Unsupervised Learning, Regression, and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). Knowledge of these topics is essential as an AI/ML practitioner and are prerequisite to topics covered in Deep-skilling.

AIAP adopts independent learning as the primary teaching methodology. Hence, similar to the Deep-skilling phase, each covered topic will have its corresponding assignment served through Jupyter Notebook. These assignments contain questions to guide your self-learning. You are free to use any legally obtainable learning resources to answer these questions and build up your knowledge pool.

## Topics

The pre-AIAP curriculum consists of the following topics:

1. [Unsupervised Learning](assignment1/README.md)
2. [Regression and Hyperparameter Tuning](assignment2/README.md)
3. [Prelude to MLOps](assignment3)

---

## Starting

You can find the learning materials for each topic under their respective folder (example `assignment1`). Each folder will contain a `README.md` file that provides an overview and deliverables of the assignment (except `assignment3`). Each folder also contains Jupyter Notebook file(s). You are to record all your answers in the Jupyter Notebook files.

We recommend the apprentices to document their answers understandably (for example, avoid just pasting the link of the learning resource. Try summarizing the essence of the article). It will allow the AI Engineers in AISG to review your work easier. More importantly, you can build your knowledge bank, which you can continuously reference in your AI/ML journey.

## Proficiency in Git

Besides the above 3 topics, we would also highly recommend incoming apprentices to deepen their proficiency in Git, which is heavily utilized throughout the programme. Below are two resources for you to choose to study Git, which are extracted from our [AIAP Field Guide](https://connect.aisingapore.org/aiap-field-guide/):

- [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) by Google (a Coursera course)
- [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) on Udacity

## Things to note
  
- **Pre-AIAP materials (assignments, sharing, project, etc) must not be shared publicly (Github, Medium, etc).**

## AIAP Deep-skilling phase (teaser)

Given the 8 weeks constraint, the AIAP Team has selected 7 leading, essential topics to be covered for the Deep-skilling phase. You can refer to the following table for a sneak peek of the Deep-skilling curriculum.

| Assignment | Topic                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 1          | Classification              |
| 2          | MLOps                       |
| 3          | Artificial Neural Network   |
| 4          | Computer Vision             |
| 5          | Time-series                 |
| 6          | Natural Language Processing |
| 7          | Large Language Model        |
| 8          | Mini-project                |
